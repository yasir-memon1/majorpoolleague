            <p className="text-gray-600 text-base text-justify">A big congratulations goes out to Steve Deluna, Kevin “Foogie” Ringlero, Darryl Davis & Anthony Begay of 3 NDNs N Dat Guy! They defeated Going for Three, We Own the Money, Coke Fueled Rage & the reigning champions Ohhh Those Guys twice to go 5-0 and become the AZPL Summer 2024 State Champions and win $4,000!</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 text-base text-justify">The Championships began on Thursday, August 29th at Dozer’s Grill with a blind draw scotch-doubles/singles tournament! If you haven’t been to Dozer’s you need to check it out! 20 7-foot Diamonds and 8 9-footers! Dart boards too! It’s a new room on the far east side, 7012 E Hampton to be exact. For those of you with kids you might remember the old Chuck E Cheese. Same place. We play there on Thursday nights! Check it out. Anyway, 18 players participated and in the end it was Sammy Martinez & Eric Culpepper winning the scotch side. On the singles side Mike Chapa and Doug Cochran battled it out to team up for the scotch. They beat Sammy & Eric the first time but Eric & Sammy came back to clinch the victory and $180! 2nd took home $120 with BC Antonio and Esteban Eureste split $60 for 5th!</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 text-base text-justify">On Friday there were 4 different tournaments to play in! An 8-ball, 9-ball & 10-ball singles tourneys as well as our own 8-Ball Break & Run Derby. In the singles tourneys it was a race to 1 in each round. There were 29 players in the 8-Ball tourney. Robert Berry & Mike Chapa split $330 for the win. Carl Stewart finished in 3rd and won $100. Steve Deluna was in 4th with $80. Aric Thompson & Chris Navas tied for 5th and won $35 each.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 text-base text-justify">The 9-Ball tourney had 14 players in it. Aric Thompson defeated Nate Holliday to take 1st place and win $140! Nate received $90 for 2nd. Andrea “Double A” Berchtold of Daddy O’s fame finished 3rd and won $50!</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 text-base text-justify">Twenty players signed up for 10-ball. Mike Sandoval won the hot seat but it was Sammy Martinez who defeated him twice for the victory and $150 for 1st place! Mike took home $115 for 2nd. Mike Chapa finished in 3rd and won $85. Fourth paid out $50 to Robert Berry!</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 text-base text-justify">In 8-Ball Break & Run Derby there were 28 participants! Leading the pack after the opening round was Bernardo Garcia & Robert Berry, both tied with 30 and Frank Caddell with 28. The cutoff was 6 to make it to the next round! In round 2 Bernardo added 26 to his score to take the lead with 56. Mike Sandoval also scored 26 to move into 2nd with 43. Equaling his 43 was Mike Chapa who scored 20. 20 was also the magic number to make it to the 3rd round! It was there that Robert Berry came roaring back with 20 points to take the lead with 58! Mike Chapa added 14 to finish at 57! Sandoval knocked in 11 for a final score of 54 to take 3rd! In the finals it was the Sandman opening with 45 points to take 1st and win $70! Mike Chapa finished in 2nd and took home $40! Robert Berry took home $20 for 3rd place!</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 text-base text-justify">On Saturday Dozer’s opened their doors at 9am for us! The first teams didn’t start until 11am so there was lots of warm up time and breakfast too! Breakfast burritos and sandwiches! 46 teams played on Saturday with 13 teams playing at 11! Of those early birds it was the Desert Rats who went the farthest without losing winning 3 straight before losing to No Clue! By the end of the night there were just 4 undefeated teams — Ohhh Those Guys vs Noice Toyche Biotch and Coke Fueled Rage vs 3 NDNs N Dat Guy. Three other teams won 3 straight on the winner’s side — DMT We’re DYnoMITE, Going for Three and Ohhh Those Guys. On the left side there were still 8 teams in contention heading into Sunday and one of them was the Desert Rats who won 2 straight! They went the farthest of all the Saturday morning starters. Going for Three won 5 straight on the left side before finishing the weekend in 3rd place with $1,500! The number #1 ranked team Shake, Rack & Run went 2-3 and finished in 8th with $350. They got beat by Show George the Money who went 3-2 to finish in 7th with $650. The 3 Blind Mice, who started in the 21st spot won 5 straight on the left side after starting 1-1 and finished 6-3 to finish in 6th with $500. 5th place and $1,000 went to Noice Toyche Biotch who finished 3-2. Coke Fueled Rage took 4th and $1,000 after going 4-2.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 text-base text-justify">In their first match the 3 NDNs N Dat Guy faced off against Going for Three. They shut them out 60-27 in 6. In their next match they played Daddy’s In-House champs We Own the Money. It didn’t start off so well as they lost the first 2 games before Foogie put out the fire winning 10-3. Deluna won the next one before Anthony Begay hit an 8-ball break in the 5th! In the 6th it was Chad with a win but the 3 NDNs won the next two for a 68-53 victory! Onto their next match against the Shamrock leaders Coke Fueled Rage! They started off strong in this one winning their first three to take a 30-17 lead into the 2nd round. The Rage finished their Coke by now and outscored them 27-23 while winning to make it a 53-44 match heading into the final round. 2 10s put it out of reach as the NDNs win this one 73-57! In the battle for the hot seat they faced Ohhh Those Guys for the first time. The Sandman lead it off with a break & run for Those Guys but those NDNs came roaring back with 3 straight wins to take a 40-29 lead. It was Bernardo’s turn to stop the bleeding and beat Anthony 10-3 but those pesky NDNs won the next 3 to win 73-55 sending the champs to the left side and await their opponent! The loss sent the champs to the triple threat to close out the left side. They faced off against Going for Three and Coke Fueled Rage. Mike Sandoval had 2 break & runs and scored 32 as they beat Going for Three 69-61. Against the Rage they took their 1st lead in game 4 37-36 before giving it right back 10-5 for a 46-42 score. The next 3 were like the ’29 Yankees with Sandoval, Garcia and Sandoval again with a 30-10 run for a 72-56 lead and the win! They had some unfinished business with some NDNs N Dat Guy…. Those 3 NDNs N Dat Guy were well rested and ready for action as they jumped to a 42-9 lead after 3 games, holding Sandoval to 2 points! In the 2nd round Those Guys snapped out of it and won 2 to score 24 to their 19 but Foogie beat Sandy 10-4 for a 61-33 lead after 6 games! Needing to go 30-2 over the next 3 games in game 7 Bernardo beat Deluna but Steve scored 7 to clinch the victory! Fitting for Steve as he has been playing in the league since the fall of 2005! Anthony Begay has been playing consistently since the summer of 2008, his first 15 years in Flagstaff, first as a player then as the league rep! He’s now in charge of the Thursday Dozer’s division! Foogie & Darryl just started playing in the league last season. Foogie went 9-2 with 103 points scored for a 1.689 PR to earn team MVP honors!</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 text-base text-justify">On Sunday we also had the Third Elimination Bracket with the winner receiving $1,000 courtesy of Dozer’s Grill! Every team that lost twice on Saturday and the first two rounds Sunday went into this bracket. Showing up is half the battle in this one as only 22 teams returned to compete for a grand! Of those 22 it was Lucky Roll & Unholy Trinity who both won 4 and split it $500 a piece!</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 text-base text-justify">If you were unlucky enough to lose your first match on Sunday you fell into the “I Guarantee You’ll Play 2 on Sunday” bracket with the winner receiving a free season! No weekly dues for the entire season! 12 teams played in this bracket with No Name from Flagstaff pulling out the victory!</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 text-base text-justify">Overall MVP of the tournament goes to Jim Rigney of the 3 Blind Mice! He went 19-3 while scoring 206 points, allowing just 112 and shooting a 28.09 match average for a 3.883 Power Rating! Lou Smith of the Desert Rats was the women’s MVP going 10-10 with 155 scored and 146 allowed along with a 23.25 match average for a PR of 1.180! Harold Lyons of Going for Three led all players with 262 points scored. He and his teammate Francisco Serrano tied with 20 wins! Mindy Teague led the ladies with 168 points. Josh Branham hit 2 8-ball breaks! Mike Sandoval recorded 3 break & runs and Nate Holliday picked up 3 10-0s!
